## Parking data analysis
The goal of this analysis was to understand the fluctations in demand for a parking lot in Milan. The data provided contained two measures of demand, number of clients and revenues, aggregated at the daily level.
More specifically the purpose was to:
- uncover possible seasonality effects
- analyze differences between weekdays vs weekends
- understand if weather conditons (rain in particular) have an effect on revenue generation and demand

To carry out this taks I scraped some historical weather data from a weather forecasting website and merged them together with the dataset provided by the company.

The main finding of the analysis are:
- there is a seasonal effect, with more people visiting the parking lot during summer months (July - September)
- the parking lot is mainly used for "sosta lunga" meaning for longer stops, which also generate more revenues
- demand is higher during weekdays (Monday-Friday)
- demand is lower when it rains

The report was written in a second moment following the framework presented in the paper "Theory-Driven Strategic Management Decisions" (Camuffo et. al, 2022), for a university group project.
